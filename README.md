# Single Page Application (SPA) with Auth0 Authentication

This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that implements user authentication using Auth0. It includes features for user login, signup, and password reset.

## Features

- User Login
- User Signup
- Password Reset

## Prerequisites

- Auth0 account and configuration (Domain, Client ID, etc.)
- Web hosting or a local server environment (like Apache, Nginx, or equivalent)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Place the source code in your web server's public directory.
3. Ensure that the Auth0 configuration details are correctly set up in the application (domain, client ID, etc.).

## Usage

1. **User Login:**
   - Users can log in using their username and password.
   - There is a link to change the password if needed.
   
2. **User Signup:**
   - New users can sign up by providing their username, email, and password.
   - After signing up, users can log in with their credentials.

3. **Password Reset:**
   - Users can reset their password by clicking on the 'Change Password' link on the login page.
   - They need to provide their email address, and a password reset link will be sent to them.

## Configuration

Ensure you have the following in your Auth0 account:

- A Database Connection (e.g., `db-conn`).
- An Application set up in Auth0 with the correct settings for your SPA.

In your application's code, update the Auth0 configuration details:

```javascript
// Example configuration details
auth0Client = await auth0.createAuth0Client({
    domain: '<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
    clientId: '<YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>'
    // Other configurations
});
```

## Password Reset Functionality

The password reset feature uses Auth0's `changePassword` method. Ensure that the email templates and settings in Auth0 are correctly configured for password reset functionality.

```javascript
webAuth.changePassword({
    connection: 'db-conn',
    email: 'foo@bar.com'
}, function (err, resp) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    } else {
        console.log(resp);
    }
});
```
